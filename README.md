# Parsing-krisha.kz
In this project I used web crapping based on selenium to automatically get the data from website "Krisha.kz". 
(It is a site for trading houses, apartments and other estate). 
Then I put the collected data to several dataframes and analyzed them using numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib.
